This is part of a system for a project i was working on and might use again,

this looks for images through the selenuim webdriver with reference name

downloads the images to a folder with the reference name and a random string.

## this is included in MachineLearning Repo
**I thouht it would be good as a secondary repo as it could be useful for things i do in the furture.**
